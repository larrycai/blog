title: Associate CI build information in redmine issue by using redmine REST API
tags: [jenkins, jenkins-plugin, maven, redmine]
---

## Introduction

Last time, I mentioned that there is a nice feature in [JIRA plugin](http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jira+plugin), which can associate the build information back to issue management system, and I spend one day for redmine to show how it could work, I really enjoy the coding work, here is the detail what I have done so far

There are several major technical issues to solve

1.  Update redmine issues with Redmine interface when I got build information in jenkins2.  Improve redmine plugin to add more configuration and embed one job in post-build3.  combile 1+2, when build is finished, I need to trigger the update to redmine

## Redmine REST API

The good thing for most of nice web application is it provides good API, redmine is no exception, it has [REST interface](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Rest_api) , before you use it, need some setting in your redmine system.

Enable the REST Web service and later you can find the key to access, and key is much better (cool) than normal user/password

Since it uses REST API, it is much easier for developer to contribute the native library, here is the [Rest API with Java](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Rest_api_with_java) which works toward redmine 1.1.0+, and it is very easy to get it started according to the example.

### Where to put the build information in issue

I notce there is no field to attach the build information, so I raise the [feature request #7692](http://www.redmine.org/issues/7692) into redmine forum, hopefully they can fix it, currently I can append the build information into “Description” area

## Add configuration in redmine plugin

Now comes to the jenkins put, follow the old way to add one field to put the Redmine REST Access key.

And also I need to put one checkbox for whether push the build information back to redmine. (follow the JIRA plugin’s statement ![;-)](https://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif) , and learn a little about how to add it in this section, by [http://blog.sacaluta.com/2009/04/hudson-plugin-2-adding-post-build.html](http://blog.sacaluta.com/2009/04/hudson-plugin-2-adding-post-build.html), and now it looks below

## Maven support for redmine java API

It is time to combine them together, unfortunately the redmine java API doesn’t have maven support yet, see the [task 2 in the google code](http://code.google.com/p/redmine-java-api/issues/detail?id=2) and I need to figure it out by myself, not so difficult, but still cost me one hour at least

1.  install the jar file locally (mvn install:install-file)2.  put it into one webserver (easily migrate it later)3.  add one proxy in nexus to check the jars under that web server4.  add other dependency into pom.xml

Now it is possible to deal with redmine issue in jenkins, I hard code the issue id, and when the build is finished, it can push it to the description as I wanted, Great !!

I can’t spend more time to make it work completely (find issue in the build’s change set), any volunteer ?

## Summary

When I am coding, i feel I have full of motivation and full of fun inside ![;-)](https://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif) , unfortunately it is very difficult for me to focus on this in my daily work, haha. 

back to some learnings.

*   redmine is a nice product on integration, which we can learn from technology as well like REST interface with key.*   there is some value to associate the build information with issue, it can improve the transability, hopefully I can find people or myself to finish it.
