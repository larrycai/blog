Now in my github project, I add extra build status badge using drone.io.

[drone.io](https://drone.io/) is another "Continuous Integration as-a-Service" like [travis-ci](http://travis-ci.org).

There is official instruction in http://docs.drone.io/ 

Try by learning, it is so easy to use, so this blog is just record more detail for my own experience and show the difference comparing to travis-ci.

## Getting started with Drone.io ##

Simple login using your existing github account and add new project by connecting to your opensource project.
